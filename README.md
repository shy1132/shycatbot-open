# shycatbot (aka the 9,000th automated image tweeter)
the code for [@shycatbot](https://twitter.com/shycatbot) on twitter (**does not include cats!!!**)

## run instructions
(these instructions assume that you have node.js and SOME technical knowledge)

1. download/clone the repository
2. set the config values in `rename-to-config.json` and rename it to `config.json`
3. open a terminal in the repo folder and run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. run `node .` to start the bot

## notice
this is my first open source program, very simple and dumb

but it runs 24/7 on my server quite reliably
